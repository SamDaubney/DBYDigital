    Welcome to the DBY Digital Home Page.
    The idea behind this is to show off the skills that I have in Webdesign and behind.
    All code writen here should be writen from scratch and not Copy Pasta'd from somewhere else and butchered to work
    There will be no templates here! Just (hopefully) clean code and comments!

        <p>Hello, I am Sam! Welcome to the DBY Digital Site!<br /></p>
        <p>Here I will be showcasing some of the main skills that i've developed over the past few months, the biggest one being this Site</p>
        <p>Everything on this site has been written from scratch and wont have any copy and paste code. There might be some bits of code which I've used but will have made sure I've written it my own way if possible or in a way that I understand it.</p>
        <p>Please also see below for some of my other projects, some of these are hand made and others are adjustments of code.</p>
